# memocadre configuration file

# Where to fetch photos from
sources:
  # You can define multiple sources.
  # Each source is a dictionary with a "type" field.
  # Currently, only "immich" type is supported.
  # For "immich" type, you can configure either a single instance or multiple instances.
  # See below for examples.

  # Example for a single Immich instance:
  # - type: immich
  #   instance:
  #     url: "https://immich.example.com" # URL of your Immich instance
  #     api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY" # API key for your Immich instance

  # Example for multiple Immich instances:
  # - type: immich
  #   instances:
  #     - url: "https://immich1.example.com" # URL of your first Immich instance
  #       api_key: "API_KEY_1" # API key for your first Immich instance
  #     - url: "https://immich2.example.com" # URL of your second Immich instance
  #       api_key: "API_KEY_2" # API key for your second Immich instance

  # Under "specs", you define what photos to fetch from Immich.
  # You can define multiple specs to fetch photos from different sources within Immich.
  # Available spec types are:
  #   - "random-search": Fetches photos based on a search query.
  #   - "smart-search": Fetches photos based on a smart search query (similar to Immich's smart search).
  #   - "private-album": Fetches photos from a specific private album.
  #   - "memory-lane": Fetches photos from the memory lane (photos from this day in past years).

  # Example for "random-search" spec:
  # - type: immich
  #   specs:
  #     - type: random-search
  #       # persons: Optional list of persons to filter by. Photos containing these persons will be included.
  #       # You can specify persons by "id" or "name".
  #       # persons:
  #       #   - name: "John Doe" # Search for photos containing a person named "John Doe"
  #       #   - id: "person-id-123" # Search for photos containing a person with ID "person-id-123"

  # Example for "smart-search" spec:
  # - type: immich
  #   specs:
  #     - type: smart-search
  #       query: "beach" # Query to search for (e.g., "beach", "dog", "sunset").  This uses Immich's smart search capabilities.
  #       # city: Optional city to filter by (e.g., "London", "New York"). Photos taken in this city will be prioritized.
  #       # city: "London"
  #       # persons: Optional list of persons to filter by.
  #       # persons:
  #       #   - name: "Jane Doe" # Search for photos containing a person named "Jane Doe"

  # Example for "private-album" spec:
  # - type: immich
  #   specs:
  #     - type: private-album
  #       id: "album-id-456" # ID of the private album you want to display.  You can find the album ID in the Immich web interface URL when viewing the album.

  # Example for "memory-lane" spec:
  # - type: immich
  #   specs:
  #     - type: memory-lane # Fetches photos from the memory lane (photos from this day in past years).

  - type: immich
    instances:
      - url: "https://immich.example.com" # Replace with your Immich instance URL
        api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY" # Replace with your Immich API key
    specs:
      - type: memory-lane # Example spec: memory lane
